## House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features (like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) using Machine Learning models.
The goal is to demonstrate how regression techniques can be applied to real estate datasets.

# 📖 Introduction

House price prediction is a common ML use case in the real estate industry.
Accurate predictions can help:

Buyers estimate property value 💰

Sellers decide the best listing price 📢

Investors identify profitable opportunities 📈

In this project, we use data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models to predict house prices.

# ✨ Features

📂 Data loading & cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – correlations, distributions, scatter plots

🔧 Feature Engineering – scaling, transformation

🤖 Model Training – Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

✅ Evaluation – RMSE, MAE, R² Score

📉 Visualization of actual vs predicted prices

📂 Project Workflow
